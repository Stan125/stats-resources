### Basic statistical theory

Teacup Giraffes https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/01_introToR.html

*Alex says: I really like this site. I'd been looking for something like this to recommend to people for a long time. It teaches you about some of the basics of statistical theory. Formulae get translated into animations that are intuitive to understand. At the same time it teaches you enough R (the statistical programming language) so that you can reproduce the graphs and plots in their teaching examples. I've always thought this kind of approach would be the best way to learn statistical theory from scratch.*

Seeing Theory https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/

*Alex says: This is a really beautiful series of interactive animations that illustrate some really important concepts in probability and statistical theory. It's a great companion piece to a textbook, lecture, or something more static. Just as for **Teacup Giraffes** the formulae are presented alongside some interactive plots in a way that makes the theory much easier to absorb. Their animations on point estimation and confidence intervals are really worth checking out.*

### Statistical Inference

*Alex says: I've often used the null hypothesis statistical test visualisation/power calculator to illustrate the concept of statistical power to students. Worth visiting that page for some of the quotes provided alone. Since that visualisation there are a number of new visualisations that illustrate some really important and often misunderstood concepts like p-values and equivalence testing.*
